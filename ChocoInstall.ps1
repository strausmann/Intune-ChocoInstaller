.SYNOPSIS
Script to install chocolatey packages via Intune Win32App
.DESCRIPTION
Combining this script with the power of Win32App deployment via Intune, you can use the official Chcolatey package repo to install applications
.REQUIREMENTS
This script must be run from the context of the SYSTEM account, unless -usermode switch is specified.', in which case it can be run as a non-admin.
Designed to be run by Intune or SCCM Agent.
.EXAMPLE
Installing greenshot via intune Win32App
    Install command: powershell -ex bypass -file ChocoInstall.ps1 -package greenshot
    .EXAMPLE
Installing greenshot via intune Win32App in "user mode" (for apps that install into APPDATA)
    Install command: powershell -ex bypass -file ChocoInstall.ps1 -package greenshot -usermode
.EXAMPLE
Upgrading greenshot via intune Win32App
    Install command: powershell -ex bypass -file ChocoInstall.ps1 -package greenshot -upgrade
.EXAMPLE
Uninstalling greenshot via intune Win32App
    Install command: powershell -ex bypass -file ChocoInstall.ps1 -package greenshot -uninstall
.NOTES
The usermode switch must be used on upgrade and uninstall packages as well, if the app was originally deployed using this switch.
The switch essetially installs a seperate Chocolatey installation for each user it is deployed to, seperate of the machine wide chocolatey install.
This switch will cause up to a one minute delay in the unattended installation because of warning timeouts the chocolatey enforces on non-admins.
